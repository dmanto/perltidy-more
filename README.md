# perltidy-more

Perltidy extension for Visual Studio Code.

More perltidy, then pertidy extension by sfodje.

This perltidy has some extended features:

- It has [github repository](https://github.com/kak-tus/perltidy-more) (now sfodje perltidy has [repository](https://github.com/sfodje/perltidy) too).
- It can format large perl files (in my case sfodje extension had 10 or 20 KB file limit. I don't know why it happened).
- It can format selected text.

Alternatives
1. [sfodje perltidy](https://github.com/sfodje/perltidy).
2. [henriiik intelligence extension](https://github.com/henriiik/vscode-perl) (it can format, but I couldn't get it work).
